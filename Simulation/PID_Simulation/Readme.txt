How to run these Python code for the PID simulation?

At first, you need install python with numpy and matplotlib library.
Secondly, in the command line mode, execute the following command to observe the PID performance.
$ python pid_run.py
Thirdly, observe the different PID simulation results by checking the six generated figures. One screenshot of the figures is attached in this directory.
Lastly, if you want to change the PID Kp, Ki and Kd parameters, you need open the pid_run.py file, and modify the kp, ki, and kd parameters at line 134-136.
