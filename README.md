# RTOSproj
sep200/250 project 
Repository for a project which lasted 2 semesters, 
culminating in an autonomous obstacle avoiding vehicle with 
wireless control feature to an external host control.
Wireless control supports both manual control of the vehicle, and an indoor positioning system, by planting specific coordinates for it to "home" to.
The whole vehicle's firmware is optimised in RTOS environment, to satisfy the delicate timing of the various tasks.
